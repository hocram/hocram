👋 Hi, I'm Marco Di Pasquale  
_aka [hocram](https://github.com/hocram)_

🧭 Multidisciplinary digital designer, Software engineer, Creative mind  
I design essential, lightweight, modular, and poetic tools for complex environments.  
Designing is like shaping a space: with intention, care, and silence.  
Code becomes a design language — a gesture of listening, not an end in itself.
